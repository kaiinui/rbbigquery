[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rbbigquery.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/rbbigquery)

A Ruby BigQuery client.

**This is a WIP project. Currently #insert, #query are available.**

```ruby
client = RbBigQuery::Client.new YAML.load_file "config/bigquery.yml"

schema = RbBigQuery::Schema.build do
  string :title
  string :text
end

table = client.find_or_create_table("test_dataset", "test4_table", schema)

rows = (1..5).map do |i|
  {
      title: "title: #{i}",
      text: "text: #{i}"
  }
end

puts table.insert(rows)
```

then touch `config/bigquery.yml` as following where auhentication info are available at Google Developer console -> APIs & AUTH -> Credentials.
```ruby
:application_name: YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME # You can set any name. (e.g. 'myapplication')
:application_version: YOUR_APPLICATION_VERSION # You can set any version. (e.g. '0.1')
:key_path: PATH_TO_KEY.p12 # find in Google dashboard
:service_email: YOUR_SERVICE_EMAIL # find in Google dashboard
:project_id: YOUR_PROJECT_ID # find in Google dashboard
```

Querying?
---

```ruby
client = ..
table = ..

client.query("SELECT * FROM #{table.sql_name}")
```

I'm planning to connect SQL builder so that you don't have to write painfully SQL queries.

Where can I get my keys?
---

You can find `:key_path` and `:service_email` as following.

You can find `project_id` in top page of the dashboard(which PROJECT are listed). See column 'PROJECT ID'.

TODO
---

1. Write tests. (**There's no test now. Be careful.**)
